[ ] What is albedo and attenuation?
[x] How does ray tracing work with refraction? Rays start from the viewing plan
    and go hit and bounce through objects, then eventually hit a light source. The
    directions of traced rays are the opposite of rays in real world. 
[x] Implement dielectrics material.
