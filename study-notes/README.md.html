# Strange Circular Banding

The rendered image is also very dark. 

```rust
let limits = 0.0..Fp::MAX;
let intersection = sphere.ray_intercept(ray, &limits);
```

Because I set the lower limit to 0, `ray_intercept()` would return hit when `t` is 0. This causes
a sphere to intersect with a ray bounced from the sphere itself. This would lead to infinite
loop of successful intersection test on the sphere and its bounced ray, if the trace depth is not 
capped. Because the trace depth is capped, the trace would eventually return zero, abandoning the 
contribution of the original ray. That's why the rendered image is dark. I'm not exactly sure why
the circular banding, which is also fixed by setting the lower limits to a positive non-zero
value.

To calculate refracted ray $R^\prime = R^\prime_\perp + R^\prime_\parallel$:

$$
R_\parallel = (R \cdot n)n \\
R_\perp = R - R_\parallel \\
R_\perp^\prime = sin\theta^\prime |R^\prime|\dfrac{R_\perp}{|R_\perp|} \\
\because |R^\prime| = |R| \\
R^\prime_\perp = \dfrac{sin\theta^\prime |R^|}{|R_\perp|} R_\perp \\
R^\prime_\perp = \dfrac{sin\theta^\prime}{sin\theta} R_\perp \\
R^\prime_\perp = \dfrac{\eta}{\eta^\prime} (R - (R \cdot n)n) \\
\because |R^\prime_\parallel|^2 = |R^\prime|^2 - |R^\prime_\perp|^2 \land |R^\prime| = |R| \\
R^\prime_\parallel = \sqrt{|R|^2 - |R^\prime_\perp|^2} (-n)
$$

## Black Sport at the Bottom of Dielectric Sphere

```rust
let limits = 0.0078125..Fp::MAX;
let intersection = sphere.ray_intercept(ray, &limits);
```

The lower limit for finding the intersection solution `t` is too big, causing many rays 
to be abandoned.

```rust
let limits = 0.0001..Fp::MAX;
let intersection = sphere.ray_intercept(ray, &limits);
```

## How does ray tracing work with refraction?

When tracing a ray from viewing plane to a glass object, the ray hitting the glass object is actually the 
refracted ray in real life, and the refracted ray that we calcuate is the incident ray in real life.
According to the reversibility principle of light, this is fine.
